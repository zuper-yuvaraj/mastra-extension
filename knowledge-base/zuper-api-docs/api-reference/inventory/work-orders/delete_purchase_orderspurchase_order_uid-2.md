# Delete Work Order

Operates on Service Orders, shown in the Zuper client app as "Work Order" (in every industry). Work Orders share the exact same underlying schema and endpoints as Purchase Orders / Material Orders; they're distinguished only by the `purchase_order_type` field (`SERVICE_ORDER` here) and the `/service_orders` route prefix. Soft delete — sets `is_deleted: true`, clears assigned appointments, and reverts any linked Material Request's status.
